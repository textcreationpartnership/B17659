            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Proposal for building A Royal LIBRARY, And establishing it by <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Royal Library now at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, designed and founded for publick use, was in the time of King <hi>James</hi> I. in a flourishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, well stored with all sorts of good Books of That and the preceding Age, from the beginning of Printing.</p>
            <p>But in the succeeding Reigns it has gradually gone to Decay, to the great dishonour of the Crown and the whole Nation. The Room is miserably out of Repair; and so little, that it will not contain the Books that belong to it. A Collection of ancient Medals, once the best in <hi>Europe,</hi> is embez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled and quite lost. There has been no supply of Books from abroad for the space of Sixty years last: nor any allowance for Binding; so that many valuable Manuscripts are spoil'd for want of Covers: and above a Thousand Books printed in <hi>England,</hi> and brought in Quires to the Library, as due by the Act for Printing, are all unbound and useless.</p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly proposed, as a thing that will highly conduce to the Publick Good, the Glory of His Majesty's Reign, and the Honour of the Parliament;</p>
            <p n="1">I. That His Majesty be graciously pleased to assign a Corner of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park, on the South side, near the Garden of the late Sir <hi>John Cutler,</hi> for the building of a new Library, and in the Neighbourhood of it a competent Dwelling for the Library-Keeper.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This Situation will have all the advantages that can be wished. 'Tis an elevated Soil, and a dry sandy Ground; the Air clear, and the Light free; the Building, not contiguous to any Houses, will be safer from Fire; a Coach-way will be made to it out of <hi>Tuttle-street, Westminster;</hi> the Front of it will be parallel to the Park-Walk; and the Park will receive no Injury, but a great Ornament by it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the said Library be built, and a perpetual yearly Revenue for the Purchase of Books setled on it by Act of Parliament: Which Revenue may be under the Direction and Disposal of Curators, who are from time to time to make report to His Majesty of the State and Condition of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary. The Curators to be ............... ......................</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The choice of a proper Fund, whence the said Revenue may be raised, is left to the Wisdom of the Parliament. In the mean time, This following is humbly offer'd to Consideration.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That, as soon as the present Tax of 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon Foreign Paper, and 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon <hi>English,</hi> shall either expire or be taken off; there be
<pb facs="tcp:198845:2"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:198845:2"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:198845:3"/>laid a very small Tax of .... <hi>per Cent.</hi> (as it shall be judged suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the uses of such a Library) upon Imported Paper only, leaving our own Manufacture free. Which Tax may be collected by His Majesty's Officers of the Customs, and paid to such Person or Persons, as shall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Curators.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. This being so easie a Tax, and a Burthen scarce to be felt, can create no Damp upon the Stationer's Trade. And whatsoever shall be paid by them upon this foot, being to be laid out in the purchase of Books, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn among them again. So that 'tis but giving with one hand, what they will receive with the other.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. And whereas our Own White-Paper Manufacture, that was growing up so hopefully, and deserves the greatest Encouragement, being all clear gains to the Kingdom, is now almost quite sunk under the weight of the present Tax; this new one upon Imported Paper, with an Exemption of our Own, will set Ours upon the higher Ground, and give it a new Life. For whatsoever is taken from the one, is as good as given to the other. So that even without regard to this design of a Library, the Tax will be a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Benefit.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. A Library erected upon this certain and perpetual Fund, may be so contriv'd for Capaciousness and Convenience, that every one that comes there, may have 200,000 Volumes, ready for his use and service. And Societies may be formed, that shall meet, and have Conferences there about matters of Learning. The <hi>Royal Society</hi> is a noble Instance in one Branch of Knowledge; what Advantage and Glory may accrue to the Nation, by such Assemblies not confined to one Subject, but free to all parts of good Learning.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The Wall that shall encompass the Library, may be cased on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side with Marbles of ancient Inscriptions, Basso Relievo's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either found in our own Kingdom, or easily and cheaply to be had from the <hi>African</hi> Coast, and <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> the Less. Those few Antiquities procured from the <hi>Greek</hi> Islands by the Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> and since published both at home and abroad, are an evidence what great advancement of Learning, and honour to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be acquired by this means.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Upon this Parliamentary Fund, the Curators, if occasion be, may take up Money at Interest, so as to lay out two or three years Revenues to buy whole Libraries at once: As at this very time, the incomparable Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of <hi>Thuanus</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Marquardus Gudius</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> might be purchas'd at a very low Value.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. And since the Writings of the <hi>English</hi> Nation have at present that great Reputation abroad, that many Persons of all Countries learn our Language, and several travel hither for the advantage of Conversation: 'Tis easie to foresee, how much this Glory will be advanced, by erecting a free Library of all sorts of Books, where every Foreigner will have such convenience of studying.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. 'Tis our Publick Interest and Profit, to have the Gentry of Foreign Nations acquainted with <hi>England,</hi> and have part of their Education here. And more Money will be annually imported and spent here by such Students from abroad, than the whole Charge and Revenue of this Library will amount to.</p>
